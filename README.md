# About
 Plug n Play! This repo is focused on helping you install i3-gaps Wm on Debian/Ubuntu based systems and distros that might be limited to do so. You can download and set this up on a new minimal/server or other install you might have easily. This was made so it could also work on a Raspberry Pi (64bit distros tested), other arm systems might work with it as well (only tested on RPI for the time being).

 Although i3-gaps has been here for quite a long time, it has become harder for people new to window managers (or just i3-wm) to install i3-gaps and rice it in debian-based distros. Another problem that comes with this is the existence of systems that don't have a lot of packages or come with a setup that makes it increasingly harder to install terminals, bars, fonts and window managers. ARM based distros tend to have a big majority of these problems, most packages don't exist, or they only exist for 32bit or 64bit only versions of those distros. What I try to do is provide solutions, for those who find it hard to do it themselves on their systems, those who use arm based devices like the Raspberry Pi and/or have a distro or install that has a problem with installing fonts and packages.
